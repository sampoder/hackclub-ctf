All participants of the Hack Club CTF are required to adhere to the following rules, alongside behavior standards set out by the [Hack Club Code of Conduct](https://hackclub.com/conduct)

0) Be a good person.

1) Denial of Service is not okay, other people are playing too.

2) Illegal tools are not permitted, don't get us in trouble.

3) Don't look up the solutions. If you're stuck, ask in #ctf-war-room instead.

4) Don't attack the server itself. You do not have permission.

5) Never go further than you need to, don't be greedy.

6) SSH is open. That does not mean it's for you.

7) Don't run commands that you dont understand.
