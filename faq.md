### What's a CTF?
A CTF, or capture the flag event, is kinda like a hackathon, but for cybersecurity. The objective is to capture the most flags, which are random strings which you'll find by hacking into a certain insecure application that will not be named :) We think this can be a fun, competitive event, as well as a great opportunity for the community to gain a better understanding of securing web apps by observing and exploiting vulnerabilities in an existing web application. Also, free GP anyone?

### Can beginners particpate?
Of course! We've got challenges for all skill levels and we'll be hosting a short workshop after the opening ceremony to help you get started.

### Are there prizes?
Yes! First place will get 100gp and get featured on Hack Club socials, 2nd place gets to ask first question on the next AMA and gets 75gp, and 3rd place gets 60gp! The highest scoring beginner will get a custom [Hackagotchi egg](https://hackagotch.io), the 2nd highest scoring beginner will get 50 gp, and the 3rd highest scoring beginner will get 25 gp. Prizes are subject to change, and this page will be updated if that happens.

### How do I participate?
To participate, you’ll sign up through CTFd, which is the system that will manage scoring. Once the CTF has started, you can login and gain access to a Jeopardy-style board of challenges. When you complete a challenge, you’ll be given a random string, or ‘flag’, which you can enter into CTFd for points.

### Do we need to be in teams?
To sign up on CTFd, you have to create a team, but you can be a team of one. It doesn't matter who is on a team - as long as there are 4 or less people on your team you'll be fine.
